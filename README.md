Making a finance recording to track user's income and outcome

There is 4 categories we have:
1. Food
2. Vacation
3. Transportation
4. Saving

We can choose what categories that we want to use and how much money that we had and spend.
This code too help us tracking date when we had income and outcome.

note:
there are several things that we have to config:
1. def read_config(filename='config.ini')
   We need to add file address for config.ini that we use

2. original_image = Image.open("logo")
   We need to add file address for picture + picture format that we use
